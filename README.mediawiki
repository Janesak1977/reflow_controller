== Reflow controller ==
---

=== Summary ===

This controlls a reflow oven using a Atmega32u4 mcu, MAX6675 thermocouple chip, K-type thermocouple and solid state relay.


This code is forked from Dan Strother's reflow controller code here: http://code.danstrother.com/reflow_controller

I've made the following modififcations

* Ported to atmega32u4 (instead of Dan's at90usb1267)
* Fixed USB serial sync issues and SPI read issues encountered
* Ability to use a single thermocouple, SSR
* Optionally turn off temp moving average
