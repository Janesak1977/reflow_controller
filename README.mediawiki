== Reflow controller ==
---

=== Summary ===

This controlls a reflow oven using a Atmega32u4 mcu, MAX6675 thermocouple chip, K-type thermocouple and solid state relay.


=== Credits ===

This code is forked from Dan Strother's reflow controller code here: http://code.danstrother.com/reflow_controller

I've made modififcations to make it work with my atmega32u4 instead of the default at90usb1267
